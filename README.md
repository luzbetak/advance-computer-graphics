Particle Moves Simulation
=========================

A Java-based simulation that demonstrates the movement of particles across a frame with different velocities, sizes, and lifespans.

## Overview

The project consists of three main components:

1. **ParticleMoves**: The main driver class that initiates and controls the simulation.
2. **Image**: A utility class for handling image-related operations.
3. **Particle**: Defines the properties and behavior of a particle.

### ParticleMoves

This class simulates the motion of particles. It:
- Initializes particles with specific properties like position, velocity, size, lifespan, and color.
- Controls the primary operations and execution flow of the simulation.

### Image

This class provides functionalities related to images. It:
- Initializes an image with a specified width, height, and color.
- Contains methods to save the image to a file.

### Particle

This class represents a particle in the simulation. It:
- Defines properties like position, velocity, size, lifespan, and color.
- Has a method to update the particle's position based on its velocity.
